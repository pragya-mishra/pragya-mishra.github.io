Hello!

The picture you see on the blog is my artwork. Let me say this before you do, yes I am terrible with arts!  I can't even draw a straight line with a ruler. In school, I had swapped my art assignments with my brother's writing assignments. And since the trend continued during college, my friends kept me out of any artsy project they did. As much as I appreciate art and artists, making art has been a real challenge because I don't particularly enjoy coloring within the lines ( or, simply put, I am not good at that). So when I drew this masterpiece, I had to put it here!

I am a Software Engineer who enjoys problem-solving and exploring technologies. When I am not working, I enjoy going out for long walks, biking, or just sitting in a cozy corner sipping iced latte in a cafe. Recently I started taking my desire to write a bit more seriously, and ta-da - this is the outcome - a simple little space where I share a few personal anecdotes you might relate to or find amusing. I try to publish one post at least every month. Sometimes, I also record summaries or takeaways from a few of the excellent books or blogs I read.

If you would like to share your feedback with me, please do not hesitate.
