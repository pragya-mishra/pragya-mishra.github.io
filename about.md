I am Pragya. Thank you for stumbling across my blog!

It is taking me quite some time to come up with the content for this section, and I am still figuring it out; it's a good exercise so far. This blog is nothing special, just a space created by a software engineer who has an avid interest in writing.

Here I take a little space and a bit of your time to share a few personal anecdotes you might relate to or find amusing. I also keep recording summaries or takeaways from a few of the excellent books or blogs I read.

If you would like to share your feedback with me, please do not hesitate.
