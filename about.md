Hi there! 

Thank you for stumbling across my blog! I am Pragya. I am currently working as a Software Engineer based in Amsterdam. While I hate writing _about_ myself, I enjoy writing _about_ other things, which is  what the intention is. Here I take a little space and a bit of your time to share a few personal anecdotes you might relate to or find amusing. I also keep recording summaries or takeaways from a few of the qexcellent books I read.

If you would like to share your feedback with me, please use the contact form below.
