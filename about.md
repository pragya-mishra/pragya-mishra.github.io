Hi there! 

Thank you for stumbling across my blog. I am Pragya. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Booking.com, based in Amsterdam. While I hate writing _about_ myself, I enjoy writing _about_ other things, and that's what the idea is! Here I take some space and a bit of your time to share a few personal anecdotes you might relate to or find amusing. I also keep recording summaries of a few of the excellent books I read.

If you would like to share your feedback with me, please use the contact form below.
