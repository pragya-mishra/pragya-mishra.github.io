Hello there!


Why would a man in Morocco who doesn't have enough to eat buy a television? Why do the poorest in India spend 7 percent of their food budget on sugar? Poor Economics, written by the winners of the 2019 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo, is an eye-opening book that overturns the myths about what it is like to live on a very little, revealing the unexpected decisions that millions of people make every day.

This book emerges from the understanding of the economic lives of the poorest. The book has many theories that help us make sense of both: what the poor are able to achieve, and where and for what reason they need a push. The book touches on the essential aspects of people's family lives: what they buy, what they do about their children's education, the health of their children, parents and own, how many children they choose to have, and so on. The book talks about how markets and institutions work for the poor: can they borrow or save, what do governments do for them. Throughout the book returns to the same basic questions: are there ways for the poor to improve their lives, what is preventing them from being able to do these things.
