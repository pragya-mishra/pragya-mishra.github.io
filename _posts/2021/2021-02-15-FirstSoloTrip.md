title: First Solo Trip
---

I have wanted to talk about this since ever; my trip to Amritsar on 14th Jan 2017. Before I start with how did it happen, let me share why did it happen.
 
I had merely traveled in my school and college days. So, as soon as I started working at my first job as a Software Developer in July 2015, I knew I wanted to travel. I have always found people and places interesting. There is something to traveling - the stories told by someone in your railway coach, tasting various cuisines, uncovering the captivating differences, recognizing the similarities, stepping onto a place of history to peek into the past, getting closer to nature, and much more. You can see and probably relate to me that traveling is a serious business. As I started working, I planned trips with friends around. Many of you know what happens to all that planning. It goes right into the drain. After the cancellation of several planned trips because of innumerable external factors, I couldn't take it. That was the time to mute all those factors and do what I wanted. Now, the only thing left was to convince my parents about my solo travel plan to a different city. 

I am sure that you can understand how complex that would have been, and I hope that the situation gets better so that there is no need for parents to worry about their daughter's safety. I had always been accompanied by my family, even to the shops in the neighborhood. When I was away for my job, they would always call me while I was in a cab, ensure that I have company, or just stuck on the call until I reached my destination. Those were the days when Uber was not safe for solo traveling women in India. As I told them about this travel plan, to no surprise, they disapproved. But with negotiations, the planned weekend trip got cut short to a one-day journey so that I don't stay for a night there in any hotel, and with that, we reached an agreement. 

As soon as I got the green signal, I booked my bus tickets (redBus) from Delhi to Amritsar. As I booked my tickets, I received an email from redBus with the subject line "Tips For Women Travellers To Stay Safe." It had all the tips.
<blockquote style="color:grey;font-size:17px;">
Keep your friends/family informed.
Do not share your travel or accommodation details with strangers/co-passengers to avoid potential trouble from harassers.
In case you feel threatened or intimidated, or you find yourself in an unsafe situation, draw attention to yourself. Let your co-passengers or people around you know that you are in trouble. 
For any emergencies during your journey from Delhi to Amritsar on Fri 13th Jan 2017, please call 9XXXXXXXXX. This is a dedicated number to serve female passengers traveling.
</blockquote>
Need I say more? I just paused for a while and started to reconsider what I was about to do. I looked into booking flight tickets after that email, but they were costly, and also, the timing was absurd. I already had many discussions with my parents about not staying in a hotel overnight; I didn't want to do that again. So I adhered to my bus tickets. The tickets were affordable, and the timing was great, reaching Amristar in the morning and leaving by night, which gave me an entire day to explore the city. 

On 13th Jan evening, I packed a jacket, had a light dinner, and thoroughly emptied my bladder as I didn't know if the bus would stop in between; why to take a chance. I was alert and looking out for any suspicious actions with wide-opened eyes. The bus started on time, and everyone was asleep in some 30 minutes, except the bus driver (thankfully) and me. Around 2 AM, the bus stopped at a Dhaba where everyone used the restroom or had some tea/snacks. Not to mention, I was elated to use the bathroom. I ordered a tea from the stall near the bus. While I sipped the tea, I looked around people traveling with me, families, young men, and adult men. Everyone looked sleepy and freezing. I double-checked that I have important numbers on speed dial and went back to my seat. In some 45 minutes, the bus was on track and resumed the journey. 

The bus reached Amritsar around 5:30 AM; I was finally in Amritsar! As I deboarded the bus, I realized two things. First, it was freaking cold. And second, all the boards on the shop had Punjabi written on it, and that's when it hit me that I didn't think about this all while planning that I am going to a city where Hindi is not the primary language. I wore the jacket I was carrying and navigated my way to the Golden temple. The streets were so clean, and everything on those lanes looked so beautiful, I almost slipped out of the "all-time high alert" mode. 

I reached the Golden temple by the sunrise, and the view was beyond what I had in my mind. Never ever would I have thought that a place could look so serene and enchanting. What I felt at that moment cannot be described in words; a mix of relief with a tint of happiness, pride in myself, and gratitude for my family. I felt lucky to be there. I was spellbound by Gurbani and the aroma of Karah Prasad. I had my breakfast at the Langar in Sri Harmandir Sahib. The system they had put in place for Langar is a true example of what humanity is about. I was so touched that I had to take a detour from my itinerary and spend some hours in the Central Sikh Museum exhibiting the saga of Sikhism. 

Around 11 AM, I walked out of the temple premises and walked around in the city to taste the famous kulcha, lassi, and jalebi. I explored a few local stalls and shops. The food was exquisite out there, but my heart was fixed at Karah Prasad and warm Langar meal. I reached Jallianwala Bagh around the afternoon and found myself immersed in the tragic past and Amar Jyoti's energy. 

As I roamed around, I heard many taxi drivers asking for passengers willing to go to Wagah Border, which was over an hour journey (one way). While I was thinking about making time for this, a driver told me that they had special arrangements for solo traveling women. His words shocked me. Was it that obvious that I am traveling alone? And what about the arrangement? Can everyone notice this? My head was spinning with questions, vigilance, and suspicion. Before my face could tell them that I was freaked out, I rushed towards the Golden temple and immediately dropped the Wagah Border plan. I was not looking for any more adrenaline. 

I was back at Sri Harmadir Sahib around 6 PM. It was the same feeling as of a bird returning to its nest after fledging. I sat there for 2 hours, fixing my gaze onto the magical golden reflection of Darbar Sahib in the lake. It felt safe, like home. My bus from Amristar was scheduled at 10 PM, and before catching it, I had two things to do. The first was to donate some amount to the Langar at Darbar Saheb, and the second one was for the inner child's love for Karah Prasad; I had to get it one last time before I leave. After the two things got ticked off my list, I grabbed dinner from a restaurant on the way to the bus station. The bus was on time, and the return journey was smooth. I reached Delhi Bus station around 4:30 AM and completed an adventurous ride. 

The trip lasted only 32 hours, but it had all the colors. I was scared; I was thrilled; I was alert; I was bewitched; I was sleep-deprived; I was adventurous; I was responsible. Even the most trivial moments from this trip are etched in my memory, being the best souvenir I could have asked for.
