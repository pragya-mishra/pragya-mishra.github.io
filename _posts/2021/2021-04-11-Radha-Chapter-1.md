I dedicate this space to Radha and other underprivileged kids for their everlasting yearning for education, the incredible volunteers I work with, and the power of technology.

If you have any preconceived impression concerning how I would boast about being a humanitarian in further conversation, please stop and save your time by redirecting your energy somewhere else. I closely know tens of volunteers who go way out of their comfort zones for these underprivileged children, far beyond what I can even imagine, so I assure you that my egotism is in check. My only motive to discuss this with you is to let you know how small yet consistent efforts can have an incredible impact. If you are still here, I hope you take something constructive from this read.

As the pandemic hit the world and the first wave surged in India around late March 2020, India announced its first national lockdown. Because of the misfortune put on these migrant families, they had no other option but to flee to their villages. The kids enrolled with the NGO were facing the same unfortunate fate concerning their future. As the government schools were closed, they were at risk of dropping out of their schools and jeopardizing their education. As the lockdown restrictions were enforced, the volunteers shifted to online mediums for conducting classes, but the kids didn't have adequate resources even to continue that. To help the kids resume their studies and aid their families in the city, the volunteers drove multiple programs. Kudos to the extraordinarily dedicated team of volunteers and the exceptional couple who led all of this. With the aid of donated mattresses, laptops, tablets, mobile phones, a hostel was established for these kids to stay in and resume their classes in a few weeks. 

I was following these advancements all along. I wanted to contribute, but before that, I tried to ask myself if I could commit to dedicating my time and energy to teaching kids consistently. At least with teaching kids, consistency is essential; this is what I have learned from my experience. I am not saying that you have to be there for years. No one can make that sort of commitment, except I know a few gems who have done this, and I respect them immensely. If you want to teach children and see them improve, being consistent for at least a few months is essential for them and you. Yes, you. When you teach a kid, there are days when you might feel that there is no progress and lose motivation, but consistency and patience are critical to achieving anything rewarding. You might have to change your style of teaching and engaging them. You might have to spend more energy and time than you anticipated. But you know that it's all worth it.

In October 2020, I finally put my thoughts into action and reached out to the team of volunteers to know if I could contribute in any capacity. I mentioned I could take maths, science, computer programming, or classical music vocal lessons online. They told me about this girl in class 7th who was interested in building websites, and I could have 1:1 sessions on Google hangouts with her. This is how I met Radha. She is one of the students in the hostel, where she has access to resources to study online. I take her classes twice a week, one hour each session. We started the class with basic HTML and CSS lessons. She is an intelligent student who readily grasps an idea and never hesitates at asking questions. Once, we had a small exam using Google Forms about HTML and CSS, which she nailed. She told me she wanted to build something to show others what she is learning. We started discussing various websites, their theme, content, and what resources are present on the internet to build websites for free. I assigned her the task to develop an idea for the website and search where we can host this website. Besides a bit of my help in setting the website and making it secure, she completed this project all by herself, using WordPress and watching tutorial videos online. After she developed the website, we had a small presentation where she gave me an overview of what she had learned in the past six months. This is the website - [https://garden.epizy.com/](https://garden.epizy.com/) - her first live project! It's just a prototype, and the site is not functional as per to greet a tree. :)  

I feel grateful to have got this second chance with Radha after [Kiran](https://pragya-mishra.blog/Kiran/), and I hope this blog post is just the first chapter of this story.
