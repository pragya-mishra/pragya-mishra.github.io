title: Premchand's Godaan (गोदान)
description: Book summary for Munshi Premchand's Godaan
---

Godaan is a Hindi novel written by Munshi Premchand, themed around the socio-economic deprivation and the exploitation of the village poor. This was first published in 1936 and is recognized as one of the greatest Hindi novels of modern Indian literature. The name of the book, Godaan, means donating a cow to a charity. It is regarded as a crucial Hindu ritual, as it helps in absolving one's sin and achieving salvation.

This was my first time reading a novel written in Hindi. Usually, I research the author after completing their book, but this time it was an exception. When I read the first chapter of this book, his words and slang reminded me of the dialect prevalent in my village, and I got intrigued to know about him.

Above is the second chapter's opening line, which tells the reader the name of two villages he was using in his narrative and then bluntly declared no requirement to further mention what district they are in. I found that humorous, and now I had to look him up! Munshi Premchand (Dhanpat Rai Srivastava) was born in 1880 in a village near [Benares district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi). He started writing at the age of thirteen. His work includes novels in both Urdu and Hindi. Those of you who might be interested in knowing the association between these two languages, refer [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language). Throughout this book, his storytelling, writing, slang, mundanity and peculiarities of characters hooked me. As I read this book, I transitioned from reminiscing to feeling uneasy with the underlying issues raised in the novel which wrongly seem to exist until this day, after 80+ years. 

The story revolves around various characters illustrating the different sections of the Indian community. The rural society is represented by the family of Hori Mahato (peasant), Dhania (wife), Rupa and Sona (daughters), Gobar (son), Jhunia (daughter-In-law), Heera (Hori's brother); and villagers Bhola (cowherd), Dattadin (brahmin priest and moneylender), Matadin (son of Dattadin), Siliya (cobbler's daughter and Matadin's love interest). The urban society is represented by Ms. Malati Devi (doctor), Mr. Mehta (lecturer and philosopher), Mr. Khanna (banker), Govindi (Khanna's wife), Rai Sahib (zamindar).

The novel comprises many subplots. While canvassing from the village's most impoverished to the cities' richest, Premchand also raised these three issues through various narratives.  

1. Caste segregation and exploitation of peasants: Datadin and Rai Sahib, who represented the uppermost caste, exploited the lower caste villagers, Hori, Bhola, and Siliya. The zamindars collected the revenue from peasants and imposed fine. The peasants could not pay the debts in time, and it got multiplied over time, leading to a debt trap.

2. Women facing patriarchy: For Dhaniya, a bold and devoted wife who was supportive of her husband, there were instances where Hori was described beating her. Other characters, Siliya, Jhunia (both from the rural side), and Govindi (from the city), were exploited by men they loved and supported through thick and thin. 

3. Relationships, love, and marriage: There are many shades here. There are narratives about the problems faced in inter-caste marriages of Gobar and Jhunia, Matadain and Siliya. Story of Mr. Khanna and his wife's tense love life, where he lacks love and respect for her. Thought-provoking discussions on the issues of love, the institution of marriage, the relation of man and woman, and womanhood between Mr. Mehta and Ms. Malati.

I would highly recommend this book to anybody who has read no Hindi novel before. Premchand's writing has the enormous energy of touching you and enabling you to experience what every character is going through with his words. Each character has a good and a bad side, making it a remarkably intimate portrait of life. This book doesn't end on a cheerful note, and as I mentioned, it touches on various pressing issues, so don't get surprised if you find yourself contemplating afterward.
