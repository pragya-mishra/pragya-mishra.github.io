title: Why do I write?
description: My experience with writing
---

Until this weekend, this was only a rhetorical question for me. And if I asked myself really to answer this, I would respond something similar - I write because I don't know,  I like it. Isn't that enough? Should I always have a reason? - a very much my type of answer.  

So, what changed? Why am I now thinking about this? Well, because I have no other topic on my mind. No, seriously, I am not kidding. I am still reading the book - Factfulness - a very distinct book with graphs, facts, and diagrams. And for the past few weeks, I was, let's just say busy, and couldn't take time out for writing anything. And I realized that I was missing writing! So, here I am.

Words - Lately, over time, I am learning how potent they are. The thoughts in our conscious mind still are able to find appropriate expressions, but the thoughts in our subconscious - fail miserably at this front. Often we fall short of words as soon as we try to access that subconscious mind - very similar to an error when you try to access an index that isn't in range of the list. There are usually two resolutions from here. First, our favorite is trying to quickly fix this and practice a shallow expression that is generally a distortion. Second, introspect and learn about that thought and yourself; but who got time for this? 

I don't remember when it started, but writing has been my safe place for as long as I can recall. Whenever I have to process multitudes of emotions or thoughts, I get my journal and a pen and start writing. My partner, who refrains himself from sharing any intriguing article that he found on hackernews for the time I sit with my diary, recently helped me with the right word to describe this - Reflective writing. In the beginning, I remember I struggled to be honest with myself; I still do. A part of me would judge my own thoughts while I pen them down. And not to mention fears like - What if someone reads this? What if I read it after few weeks? Writing is getting intimate with oneself - acceptance of what one is thinking at the moment and holding no judgment for one's past writings. Writing is a manifestation of accepting and forgiving oneself. As I discerned my past writings, I spotted how hard I had tried to hide my shortcomings by using convoluted words or sometimes just putting an altogether distorted version. Continuing with personal writing, I hope to learn to accept myself as a whole, not cherry-picking just the presentable parts. 

Now comes the question of why do I share some of my writings on this blog. The reason for creating a blog is that I despise the push model of social media. It feels like standing on the shore of an ocean of miscellaneous bits about people you know, and the waves just keep hitting - waves of varying (and most of the time contrasting) colors, intensity, and temperatures - as is everyone's life. One talking about elections, one enjoying an instagrammable view, one feeling grateful, one asking for covid resources and help, one showcasing their talent. While I appreciate all of these people's posts, this blog is primarily my preferred mode of communicating based on writing and pull model.

Do I write to tell about my unique story? No. We all have our unique paths. My story is not more remarkable than yours, and there is no reason you should not tell others about it if you want to. We can all learn and add few more dimensions to our lives.

Do I write to influence people? I assume this question is about influencing someone who reads my posts and has an open mind to consider my perspective. If the reader lacks open-mindedness, to begin with, I don't think this situation applies to them. And even in a case someone acknowledges my viewpoint, I am not here to influence them. Life is unfair. Unfair good and unfair bad aka good luck and bad luck.  And that's why we have unique stories. We, in general, are egoistic, and thus we don't give luck the actual share of credit in our achievements and failures. Where am I going with this? I am only conveying that I am aware - what serves for me wouldn't suit you entirely. So, I am here to just share that extra dimension from my learning which I hope you could customize for yourself.

Writing in my journal or here is a great learning experience for me, and I do it because of the pure bliss of the process. This blog adds to my joy as I can share my writing without disrupting your social media flow. I am pretty sure that I haven't yet figured out entirely why do I write; nonetheless, it appears that my first answer wasn't mistaken after all.
