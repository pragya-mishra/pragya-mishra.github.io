I have wanted to talk about this since ever; my trip to Amritsar on 14th Jan 2017. Before I start with how did it happen, let me begin with why did it happen.

I have always found people and places interesting. There is something to traveling - the stories told by someone in your railway coach, tasting various cuisines, uncovering the captivating differences, observing the similarities, stepping upon a place of history to peek into the past, getting closer to nature, and much more. You can see and probably relate to me that traveling is a serious business. Since I had merely traveled in my school and college days, I started planning trips with friends around when I began working at my first job. Many of you know what happens to all that planning. It goes right into the drain. After the cancellation of several planned trips because of innumerable external factors, I couldn’t take it. It was the time to mute all those factors and do what I had been yearning for. Now, only one piece was left to set this new plan in motion, convincing my parents about my solo travel plan to a different city.

I am confident that you can understand how complicated that would have been, and I hope that the situation gets better so that there is no need for parents to worry about their daughter’s safety. I had been accompanied by my family always, even to the shops in the neighborhood. While I was living on my own in a different city, they would call me to ensure that I had a company whenever I took a cab. If I was commuting alone, they would simply stick on the call until I reached my destination. Those were the days when Uber was not safe for solo traveling women in India. When I told them about my travel plan, to no surprise, they strongly disapproved. But with a lot of negotiations, the planned weekend trip got cut short to a one-day journey so that I don’t stay overnight in any hotel, and with that, we reached an agreement.

Once I got the green light, I booked my bus tickets (redBus) from Delhi to Amritsar. As I booked my tickets, I received an email from redBus with the subject line “Tips For Women Travellers To Stay Safe.” It had all the tips.
<blockquote style="color:grey;font-size:17px;">
Keep your friends/family informed.
Do not share your travel or accommodation details with strangers/co-passengers to avoid potential trouble from harassers.
In case you feel threatened or intimidated, or you find yourself in an unsafe situation, draw attention to yourself. Let your co-passengers or people around you know that you are in trouble. 
For any emergencies during your journey from Delhi to Amritsar on Fri 13th Jan 2017, please call 9XXXXXXXXX. This is a dedicated number to serve female passengers traveling.
</blockquote>
Need I say more? I just paused for a while and started to reconsider what I was about to do. I looked into booking flight tickets after that email, but they were high-priced, and also, the timing was ridiculous. I already had countless discussions with my parents about not staying in a hotel overnight; I didn’t want to do that again. So, I adhered to my bus tickets. The tickets were affordable, and the timing was great, reaching Amristar in the morning and leaving by night, which gave me an entire day to explore the city.

On 13th Jan evening, I packed a jacket, had a light dinner, and thoroughly emptied my bladder as I didn’t know if the bus would stop in between; why take a chance. I reached the Delhi Bus Station on time. I was watchful, looking out for any suspicious action with wide-opened eyes. The bus started on time, and everyone was asleep in about 30 minutes, except the bus driver (thankfully) and me. Around 2 AM, the bus stopped at a Dhaba where everyone used the restroom or had some tea/snacks. Not to mention, I was elated to use the bathroom. I ordered tea (kulhad wali chai) from the stall near the bus. While I sipped the tea, I quickly scanned the people around me. There were few families, but mostly young or adult men. Everybody looked sleepy and freezing. I double-checked that I have important numbers on speed dial and went back to my seat. In some 45 minutes, the bus was on track and resumed the journey.

The bus reached Amritsar around 5:30 AM; I was finally in Amritsar! As I deboarded the bus, I realized two things. First, it was freaking cold. And second, all the boards on the shop had Punjabi written on it, and that’s when it hit me that I didn’t think about this all while planning that I was going to a city where Hindi is not the primary language. I wore the jacket I was carrying and navigated my way to the Golden temple. The streets were so clean, and everything on those lanes looked so beautiful, I almost slipped out of the “all-time high alert” mode.

I reached the Golden temple by the sunrise, and the view was beyond what I had in my mind. Never would I have thought that a place could look so serene and enchanting. I video-called my parents and could see the relief on their faces. In that moment, I felt a mix of comfort with a tint of happiness, a bit of pride in myself, and immense gratitude for my family. 

While I was spellbound by Gurbani and the aroma of Karah Prasad, the time flew. I had my breakfast at the Langar in Sri Harmandir Sahib. The system they have put in place for Langar is a true example of what humanity is about. I was so touched that I had to take a detour from my itinerary and spend some hours in the Central Sikh Museum exhibiting the saga of Sikhism.

Around 11 AM, I stepped out of the Gurdwara premises and walked around in the city to taste the famous kulcha, lassi, and jalebi. I explored a few local stalls and shops. The food was scrumptious out there, but Karah Prasad and warm Langar meal at Gurudwara already had my heart. Keeping up with my itinerary, I reached Jallianwala Bagh by mid-afternoon. As I entered the Bagh, I was taken over by mixed feelings. Although it looks like an ordinary garden with some trees and residential buildings at the back, the place exudes a troubling aura. The structures and images speak about the massacre with Amar Jyoti burning with the emblem, Vande Mataram.

As I roamed around, I heard many taxi drivers shouting out their competitive deals to lure tourists willing to go to Wagah Border, which was over an hour journey (one way). While I began thinking about making time for this, a driver approached me and mentioned that he had special arrangement for solo traveling women. His words astounded me. Was it that evident that I was traveling alone? And what about the arrangement? Could everyone notice this? My head was spinning with questions, vigilance, and suspicion. Before my face could tell them that I had freaked out, I rushed towards the Golden temple and immediately dropped the Wagah Border plan. I was not looking for any more adrenaline rush. 

I was back at Sri Harmadir Sahib around 6 PM. I felt like a bird returning to its nest after fledging. I sat there for 2 hours, fixing my gaze upon the golden mystic reflection of Darbar Sahib in the lake. My bus from Amristar was scheduled at 10 PM, and before catching it, I had two things to do. The first was to donate some amount to the Langar at Darbar Sahib, and the second one was to have a handful of warm Karah Prasad one last time before I leave. After the two things got ticked off my list, I grabbed dinner from a restaurant on the way to the bus station. The bus was on time, and the return journey was smooth. The bus arrived at Delhi Bus station by 4:30 AM, and my brief excursion came to an end.

The trip lasted only 32 hours, but it had all the colors. I was scared; I was thrilled; I was alert; I was bewitched; I was sleep-deprived; I was adventurous; I was responsible. Even the most trivial moments from this trip are etched in my memory, being the best souvenir I could have asked for.
